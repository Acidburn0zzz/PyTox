# PyTox
Python binding for [Project Tox](https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aitjcize/PyTox.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aitjcize/PyTox)

PyTox is currently under development, patches are welcomed :)

There is also another project [py-toxcore](https://github.com/alexandervdm/py-toxcore) that also provides Python binding for Tox written in SWIG, but PyTox provides a more Pythonic binding, i.e Object-oriented instead of C style, raise exception instead of returning error code. A simple example is as follows:

    class EchoTox(Tox):
        def on_statusmessage(self, *args):
            fid = self.getfriend_id(TEST_ID)
            self.sendmessage(fid, "Hi, this is EchoTox speacking...")
    
        def on_friendmessage(self, friendId, message):
            name = self.getname(friendId)
            print '%s: %s' % (name, message)
	...

As you can see callbacks are mapped into class method instead of using it the the c ways. For more details please refer to `test.py`.
